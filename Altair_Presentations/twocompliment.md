# Two's Compliment

Two's compliment works by using a **signed** binary number. This means setting the binary number to negative or positive.

What would be the largest "part" of a 4-bit number would be 8 is changed where a 0 means positive, and a 1 means the negative of that position, so negative 8 in this case.

## Examples: 

### 0111 = 7 = 1 + 2 + 4

### 1110 = -2 = -8 + 4 + 2 

### To change a number from a positive to a negative, you have to flip the bits and add 1.

## Example: Let's try to make -5

### Positive 5 is 0101

1. Flip the bits: 1010
2. Add one: 1011

### 1011 = -8 + 2 + 1 = -5

# Two's compliment is important because we can use to SUBTRACT NUMBERS!!!

## Let's try 7-5:
- ### 7 = 0111
- ### 5 = 0101
- ### 7 - 5 = 7 + (-5)
- ### The two's compliment of 5 would be: 1011
- ### Line up the bits, and add them: 
    - ### 0111
    - ### 1011
    - ### 0010 = 2!
